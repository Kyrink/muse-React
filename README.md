## Process
The development of Muse began with identifying the project requirements and understanding the core functionalities needed to enhance user discovery and sharing experiences. The next step involved prototyping the app in Figma, focusing on a user-friendly interface and an engaging user experience. The implementation phase saw the integration of the React frontend with the MySQL backend using Django, overcoming challenges in map interactivity and data management.

## Learnings
The project was a deep dive into full-stack development, with significant learnings in connecting a React frontend with a MySQL database through Django. Understanding API endpoints and mastering how to fetch and send data were pivotal in making Muse a reality. The experience sharpened my skills in both frontend and backend development, API integration, and the practical application of user interface design principles.

## Improvement
- **Performance Optimization:** Further optimization can be done to improve the load times and responsiveness of the app.
- **Feature Expansion:** Adding functionalities such as social sharing, user profiles, and broader location coverage could enhance community engagement and user experience.

## Running the Project
To run Muse locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies with `npm install` for the frontend and the corresponding commands for Django and MySQL setup.
3. Start the development server with `npm start` for the frontend and the Django server for the backend.
4. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

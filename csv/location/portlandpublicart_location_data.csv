Luminous Arbor,Sculpture,Woodfords Corner,"In its simplest interpretation, Luminous Arbor is a light fixture. It is composed of a cluster of streetlights in keeping with familiar public lighting features. Here, however, the lights come to life. Rising from a single foundation, the light poles gradually diverge into individual intertwining paths . . . suggesting a tree, a swarm, or a choreographed dance . . . In this way Luminous Arbor will both illuminate and create a visual anchor at Woodfords Corner and the surrounding communities.",https://www.publicartportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/unspecified-312x247.jpg,43.6703594,-70.2842153

Link,Sculpture,1001 Westbrook St,"Jesse Salisbury’s Link series is a sculptural experiment of modular interlocking forms.  The forms are carved and split from a single rectangular granite block and then the separated forms are moved around each other to form the finished sculpture arrangement.  The result is a reductive sculpture larger than the original block with various forms possible depending on how the modular parts are arranged around each other.  In particular Salisbury likes to contrast the raw split texture of the original granite block with the carved facets.  The textures and motion of the sculpture creates a visual puzzle for the viewer to ponder the interior and exterior spaces, as well as contemplate the construction and movement.",https://www.publicartportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Link-312x247.jpg,43.6473301,-70.3101787
